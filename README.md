This is my solution for Skillsme Challenge for Junior HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

CASE STUDY
Douglas & Luis Co. is a financial company in Europe. Recently, it starts planning to enter the market in North America. And the first step for them to enter that market, the management believe is a platform where the customers in North America can easily find any stock in the market, see the trend of the price, and, in the future, buy or sell stock on that platform.

As a frontend developer, you are assigned to make the first step of this plan. You can use Yahoo Finance or any other free finance API to gather the data of the stock market, update the data every minute, and keep the last data after the bell.

You should allow your user to search for any stock in the market and visualize the data into a graph. You may want to add more features like user sign up or add the stock into collections to make it more user friendly.

SOLUTION
The first thing that I created is the header which contains the logo and a link to login page. Then, I created the search box UI at the home page. After that, I created the minimalist footer. After the home page ready, I went to the login page to created the sign in and sign up forms. Then, I use TradingView platform as my stocks resource and embed the widget in my website. Then, I made the search box working so the graph will change depends on what stock the user wants to view. That's it. I will keep take this project into the next level in the future, so I can get the result that I want earlier.

Note: If you have no idea which stock to view, simply click in the stock's symbol and choose one of them.
